                <p class="about">Charlie Cu's fascination with the visual arts began at a very young age. Through out his life he continually developed his love of the visual art mediums through sketching, drawing and painting. Charlie's fine arts disciple pushed him to pursue tattooing, where he decided to center his artistic vision and focus. He has been tattooing since 2005, taking his craft across the United States before settling in Atlanta, Georgia.  Charlieâ€™s passion and inspiration for a fine arts approach to the tattoo arts lies in the roots of Japanese and American traditional tattooing. Over the years, through his study of classical tattooing, he has grown to pursue a wide range of tattoo styles  including black and grey realism, portraiture, and realism surrealism subject matters.</p>

                                Charlie is the best artist Iâ€™ve ever had the pleasure of working with. He was so detailed and attentive. He listened to my ideas and provided the best experience Iâ€™ve ever had with an artist.
                    
                                Heâ€™s great with any styles of tattoo, and easy to talk to. I recommend Charlie to anyone whoâ€™s in Atlanta or anywhere to get in touch with him. You wonâ€™t regret it ðŸ’¯</p>

                                Got my first session with Charlie done yesterday. Every second of the session was welcoming from start to finish. Heâ€™s extremely creative and talented at what he does. He makes you feel right at home the entire time. The entire process from the setup until the tattoo itself is done very professionally. Iâ€™ve never been happier with a piece of art of gotten tattooed. Heâ€™s an extremely cool dude, very open mined, and keeps good conversation with you while he works. As well as making sure youâ€™re comfortable during your time in the shop. I will most defiantly be going back for my many tattoos to come!  </p>
